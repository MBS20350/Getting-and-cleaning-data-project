## Introduction

This project uses a modified version of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version
1.0.

The source HAR dataset was developed by:

Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.
activityrecognition@smartlab.ws
www.smartlab.ws

The dataset was developed from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket
of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded
accelerometer and gyroscope, the authors captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity
at a constant rate of 50Hz. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying
noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128
readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was
separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is
assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used.
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency
domain. The Feature variables noted below are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].  Feature variables
labeled, in part, with 'ACC' are in standard gravity units 'g.'  Feature variables labeled, in part, with
'gyro' are in radians/second.

## Files used by the run_analysis.R script

The original HAR dataset divided the data into 'train' and 'test' sets,  This project combines the two sets
into one unified tidy dataset.  Pertinent files within the original dataset used by this project include:

- 'features.txt': List of all 561 features; used within the project as column labels for the feature
   variables.  
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the six class labels with their activity name; used to build the activity
   observations.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set feature variable data.  561 different variables.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training set activity labels; its range is from 1 to 6.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Subject for each training observation; its range is from 1 to 30.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set feature variable data.  561 different variables.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test set activity labels; its range is from 1 to 6.
- 'test/subject_test.txt': Subject for each test observation; its range is from 1 to 30.

## Provided HAR Files not used by the run_analysis.R script

- 'features_info.txt': Provides background information about the feature variables. 
- 'train (or test)/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone
   accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same
   description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z
   axis. 
- 'train (or test)/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by
   subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train (or test)/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the
   gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

## Project results and product

Task Five of the project creates a new summary dataset from the original combined train and test datasets,
named "getting_and_cleaning_data_project_task5.txt".  Its variables are:

- 'subject_ID': Subject for each observation; its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'activity': Factor variable containing the six different activities noted above.
- Means of 66 different features variables involving means or std devs:  Means of each feature variable
  grouped by subject and activity.  Because the objective of the project is to wrangle data for undefined
  future analysis, an intentionally inclusive heuristic was used to identify feature means and standard
  deviations in order to provide maximum future flexibility.
